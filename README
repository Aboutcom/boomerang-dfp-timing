This plugin ties into the dfp-events library that allows you to listen in on dfp's logger function and will send back timing data associated with those events.

There are two parts to using the plugin.

dist/dfp.gpt.logger.cached.js
This file should be included on the client, ideally somewhere in the head of your page, in order to begin capturing GPT events as soon as possible.  

dist/boomerang.dfp.timing.js
This is the plugin you should include in your build of boomerang.  It can be included along with your other boomerang plugins in your Gruntfile for boomerang.

Config options:
  To initialize, the plugin assumes you pass an object similar to this:
  BOOMR.init({
    DFPTiming: {
      // CONFIG ITEMS WOULD GO HERE
      events: [
        "gpt-slot_fill",
        "gpt-slot_fetch",
        "gpt-slot_receiving",
        "gpt-slot_render_delay",
        "gpt-slot_rendering",
        "gpt-slot_rendered"
      ]
    }
  });
	
  To initialize with no config options:
  BOOMR.init({
    DFPTiming: {}
  });

Configurable items:
  events
    Optional. This is an array of strings with the names of the GPT events you want to listen to.  If not specified, the plugin will default to listening to all gpt events.
  timeout
    Optional.  This should be provided as a number in milliseconds to wait before sending the beacon.  If not provided, the plugin will send a beacon at page_unload.
