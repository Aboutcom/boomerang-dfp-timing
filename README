This plugin ties into the dfp-events library that allows you to listen in on dfp's logger function and will send back timing data associated with those events.

To use the plugin, you need to include the dfp-events library in your codebase, and dfp.events.caching.js afterwards.
The repo for dfp-events can be found here: https://github.com/mcountis/dfp-events

It is recommended to include those two files in the head of your page in order to begin capturing GPT events as soon as possible.

Then just include the path to boomerang.dfp.timing.js along with your other boomerang plugins in your Gruntfile for boomerang.

Config options:
  To initialize, the plugin assumes you pass an object similar to this:
  BOOMR.init({
    DFPTiming: {
      // CONFIG ITEMS WOULD GO HERE
      events: [
        "gpt-slot_fill",
        "gpt-slot_fetch",
        "gpt-slot_receiving",
        "gpt-slot_render_delay",
        "gpt-slot_rendering",
        "gpt-slot_rendered"
      ]
    }
  });
	
  To initialize with no config options:
  BOOMR.init({
    DFPTiming: {}
  });

Configurable items:
  events
    Optional. This is an array of strings with the names of the GPT events you want to listen to.  If not specified, the plugin will default to listening to all gpt events.
  timeout
    Optional.  This should be provided as a number in milliseconds to wait before sending the beacon.  If not provided, the plugin will send a beacon at page_unload.
