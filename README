	This plugin ties into the dfp-events library that allows you to listen in on dfp's logger function and will send 
	back timing data associated with those events.  For the plugin to work, you must include this library in your codebase,
	somewhere before you initialize this pluign and boomerang:

	https://github.com/mcountis/dfp-events

	Config options:
		To initialize, the plugin assumes you pass an object similar to this:
		BOOMR.init({
			DFPTiming: {
				// CONFIG ITEMS WOULD GO HERE
				events: [			// A list of the events you want to listen to, drawn from dfp-events plugin; if none are supplied, will default to listen to all events
						"gpt-slot_fill",
						"gpt-slot_fetch",
						"gpt-slot_receiving",
						"gpt-slot_render_delay",
						"gpt-slot_rendering",
						"gpt-slot_rendered"
				]
			}
		});

		Configurable items:
			events
				Optional. This is an array of strings with the names of the GPT events you want to listen to.  If not specified,
				the plugin will default to listening to all gpt events.
			timeout
				Optional.  This should be provided as a number in milliseconds to wait before sending the beacon.  If not provided,
				the plugin will send a beacon at page_unload.
